# 11 Dense Tracking Correlator Export

Author: Codex
Date: 2026-07-24

## Goal

Export dense tracking-domain complex correlator taps for offline multipath / multi-source fitting. This is instrumentation only: it must not change tracking lock logic, observables, PVT, or the existing dual-path output unless explicitly enabled.

## Development Checklist

- [x] Step 1: Extend `Dll_Pll_Conf` with dense correlator configuration fields.
- [x] Step 2: Parse `start:step:stop` tap strings and convert chip offsets to sample offsets inside the tracking block.
- [x] Step 3: Add an independent dense multicorrelator, gated by decimation so non-dump epochs do not compute dense taps.
- [x] Step 4: Write dense binary dump using the existing tracking dump style, plus a JSON metadata sidecar.
- [ ] Step 5: Add Python tools to inspect and plot dense correlation profiles.
- [ ] Step 6: Validate first with offline File Source, then real-time if CPU headroom is acceptable.

## Step 1 Notes

Changed:

```text
src/algorithms/tracking/libs/dll_pll_conf.h
src/algorithms/tracking/libs/dll_pll_conf.cc
```

New config fields:

```ini
Tracking_1C.dense_correlator_dump=false
Tracking_1C.dense_correlator_dump_filename=./dense_correlator_dump.dat
Tracking_1C.dense_correlator_taps_chips=-1.5:0.1:1.5
Tracking_1C.dense_correlator_decimation=20
```

Current behavior:

- Defaults keep dense export disabled.
- `dense_correlator_decimation < 1` is clamped to `1` with a warning.
- Tap string is only stored at this stage; parsing and chip-to-sample conversion are deliberately deferred to Step 2.

Decision:

Use the existing tracking dump style for the main binary stream. JSON is reserved for metadata only.

## Step 4 Notes

Changed:

```text
src/algorithms/tracking/gnuradio_blocks/dll_pll_veml_tracking.h
src/algorithms/tracking/gnuradio_blocks/dll_pll_veml_tracking.cc
```

Implemented:

- Opens a per-channel dense dump file when `dense_correlator_dump=true`.
- Writes a JSON sidecar next to the binary file: `<dense_dump>.dat.json`.
- Writes one binary record only for decimation-selected dense epochs.
- Keeps the main binary stream in the existing `ofstream.write()` style.
- Adds a separate `d_dense_correlator_initialized` flag so the dense multicorrelator is freed even if dumping is disabled later because of path/open failures.

Binary record layout:

```text
uint64  sample_counter
uint64  epoch_counter
uint32  channel
uint32  prn
uint64  tow_ms
int32   wn
float32 rem_carr_phase_rad
float32 acc_carrier_phase_rad
float32 carrier_doppler_hz
float32 carrier_phase_step_rad
float32 carrier_phase_rate_step_rad
float32 rem_code_phase_chips
float32 code_phase_step_chips
float32 code_phase_rate_step_chips
float32 cn0_snv_db_hz
float32 carrier_lock_test
complex64[tap_count] tap_iq
```

Metadata fields include:

- `tap_count`
- `taps_chips`
- `decimation_epochs`
- `sampling_frequency_hz`
- `code_samples_per_chip`
- `record_size_bytes`
- field names and primitive types

Judgment:

The dense binary file is not converted to `.mat` in this step. A dynamic number of taps fits better with a small JSON-described binary reader, which will be added in Step 5.

## Step 2 Notes

Changed:

```text
src/algorithms/tracking/gnuradio_blocks/dll_pll_veml_tracking.h
src/algorithms/tracking/gnuradio_blocks/dll_pll_veml_tracking.cc
```

Implemented:

- Parses `Tracking_XX.dense_correlator_taps_chips` as `start:step:stop`.
- Rejects malformed specs, zero step, wrong step direction, and more than 257 taps.
- Converts tap offsets from chips to samples using `d_code_samples_per_chip`.
- Stores both forms:
  - `d_dense_code_shift_chips`: chip units for metadata / human inspection.
  - `d_dense_code_shift_samples`: sample units for the multicorrelator.
- If parsing fails while dense dump is enabled, dense dump is disabled with a warning rather than affecting normal tracking.

Judgment:

The existing `d_local_code_shift_chips` name is misleading because it stores sample offsets. Dense export therefore uses an explicit `d_dense_code_shift_samples` name for the internal values. This directly addresses the tap-unit trap noted in the handoff.

## Step 3 Notes

Changed:

```text
src/algorithms/tracking/gnuradio_blocks/dll_pll_veml_tracking.h
src/algorithms/tracking/gnuradio_blocks/dll_pll_veml_tracking.cc
```

Implemented:

- Added an independent `d_dense_multicorrelator_cpu`.
- Added `d_dense_correlator_outs` for dense complex correlator outputs.
- Initializes the dense multicorrelator only when `dense_correlator_dump=true` and the tap config parsed successfully.
- Sets dense local code and sample-offset taps in `start_tracking()`, after the PRN-specific tracking code is generated.
- Gates dense correlation computation in `do_correlation_step()` by `dense_correlator_decimation`.

Important judgment:

The decimation gate is placed before `Carrier_wipeoff_multicorrelator_resampler()`. Non-selected epochs therefore do not compute dense taps at all, which keeps the added CPU cost approximately `1 / dense_correlator_decimation` of full dense tracking.

Current limitation:

This step computes dense taps but does not persist them. File output, metadata sidecar, and carrier phase fields are Step 4.
